1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
 - Answer: 1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed.
 - Because all other options just doesn't look right and we just learned about Github action that meets the requirement in the question.
 - Although I think it would be great to be able to manually run test locally and not have to only test them when trying to push, I think this is just not the requirement of "automated" tests the question is asking
 - Run the tests all after all development is just going to be a mess if there exists bugs in the code.
